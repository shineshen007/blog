I am now a Ph.D. candidate student in SIBS, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). 
I am broadly interested in Metabolomics, Analytical chemistry, Biostatictics, 
Systems biology and Bioinformatics.

My research focuses on the development of bioinformatic algorithms and tools 
for large-scale metabolomics as well as its application in discovering new 
biomarkers related to human diseases.
