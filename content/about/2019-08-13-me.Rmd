# Academic interst
  I am now a Ph.D. candidate student in SIBS, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). 
I am broadly interested in Metabolomics, Biostatictics, Systems biology and Bioinformatics.

  My research focuses on the development of bioinformatic algorithms and tools 
for analyzing metabolomics data as well as its application in discovering new 
biomarkers related to human diseases.
