# Academic interest
I am now a Ph.D. candidate student in SIBS, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). 
I am broadly interested in Metabolomics, Biostatictics, Systems biology and Bioinformatics.

My research interest is the development of bioinformatic algorithms and tools 
for analyzing metabolomics data as well as its application in discovering new 
biomarkers related to human diseases. 


# Personal interest
  Actually，I am a bboy who is undertaking PhD study, I like breaking dance and play badminton sometimes。
  
  实际上我是个正在读博的bboy，但是现在很久都跳不上一次舞了，各种原因吧，心里很想像大学时代那样，每天晚上都去跳舞，完了洗个澡，特别舒服，强身健体。现在每天“下班”都很累，锻炼的机会也好少了。偶尔去打打羽毛球，还经常没有场地可以玩。。。不知道毕业以后会不会好点呢，期待吧
